# N4W-Facility-Codes

## Repository Overview

Welcome to the `n4w-facility-codes` repository. This repository is designed to house all the scripts and codes used by the technical-scientific team at the Nature for Water (N4W) Facility. 
The repository is structured to organize scripts across different programming languages and domains, ensuring ease of collaboration, maintenance, and scalability.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

### 1. `scripts/`
This directory contains all the scripts written in various programming languages. Each language has its own subdirectory to keep the code organized and easy to find.

- **`scripts/python/`**: Contains Python scripts. Use this directory for any Python-based tools, data processing scripts, or analyses.
- **`scripts/R/`**: Contains R scripts. Place any R-based data analysis, statistical models, or visualization scripts here.
- **`scripts/matlab/`**: Contains MATLAB scripts. This is where you store scripts related to mathematical modeling, simulations, or other MATLAB-based analyses.
- **`scripts/fortran/`**: Contains Fortran scripts. Use this directory for high-performance scientific computing, especially for legacy models or computational tasks.
- **`scripts/cpp/`**: Contains C++ scripts. This is intended for high-performance tasks, simulations, or computational models that require the efficiency of C++.
- **`scripts/java/`**: Contains Java scripts. Store any Java-based applications, tools, or utilities here.
- **`scripts/bash/`**: Contains Bash scripts. Place any shell scripts for automation, file management, or other command-line tasks here.

### 2. `scripts/data_processing/`
This directory is meant for scripts that specifically handle data processing tasks. These might include cleaning, transformation, aggregation, or preparation of datasets that will be used in analyses or modeling.

### 3. `scripts/modeling/`
This directory is designated for scripts and tools related to building, running, and validating models. This could include hydrological models, water resource management models, or any other type of computational modeling used within the N4W facility.

### 4. `scripts/visualization/`
This directory houses scripts that are used for creating visualizations. These could be plots, charts, maps, or any other type of data visualization generated from the processed data or modeling results.

### 5. `scripts/utils/`
This directory is for utility scripts that may not fit into the other categories. These might include helper functions, common libraries, or scripts that support the main analyses or modeling work.

### 6. `data/`
This directory is organized to manage datasets efficiently.

- **`data/raw/`**: Contains raw, unprocessed data. This is where original datasets are stored before any processing or cleaning is applied.
- **`data/processed/`**: Contains processed data that has been cleaned, transformed, or otherwise prepared for analysis or modeling.
- **`data/external/`**: Contains data sourced from external providers or collaborators. This might include datasets that are not generated internally but are crucial to the analyses.

### 7. `docs/`
This directory is for documentation related to the scripts, models, and data in the repository.

- **`docs/api/`**: Documentation related to APIs used or created within the project.
- **`docs/examples/`**: Example scripts or walkthroughs demonstrating how to use the tools or scripts provided in this repository.
- **`docs/references/`**: References, papers, or other supporting documents that provide context or background for the scripts and models in the repository.
